## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning README  

### Introduction  
This README provides instructions on how to run the code for the "Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning" assignment. The code is written in Python v3.11.0, and it is recommended to use Python >=3.10 for compatibility.
  
### Prerequisites  
Before running the code, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

### Project Structure
Make sure the zip folder heart_disease_prediction is located in the same directory as the notebook assignment1. The folder structure should look like this:

Asgn1_21IM30005/  
    ├── assignment1.ipynb  
    ├── heart_disease_prediction/  
    │   ├── ...  
    │   └── ...  
    └── requirements.txt  

### Running the Code
Once you have installed the required libraries and organized your project structure as described above, you can run the code by opening the ```assignment1.ipynb``` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python IDE of your choice.


The zip folder ```heart_disease_prediction.zip``` should be in the same directory as the notebook ```assignment1.ipynb```
