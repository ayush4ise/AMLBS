## Breast Tumour Classification README  

### Introduction  
This README provides instructions on how to run the code for the "Breast Tumour Classification" project. The code is written in Python v3.11.0, and it is recommended to use Python >=3.10 for compatibility.
  
### Prerequisites  
Before running the code, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

### Project Structure  
The folder structure should look like this:

21IM30005_A1/  
    ├── project1.ipynb  
    ├── breast cancer.csv
    ├── logistic_regression.py
    └── requirements.txt  

### Running the Code
Once you have installed the required libraries and organized your project structure as described above, you can run the code by opening the ```project1.ipynb``` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python IDE of your choice.
