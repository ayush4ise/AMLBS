## CNN-Based Breast Cancer Classification and Evaluation README

### Introduction  
This README provides instructions on how to run the code for the "CNN-Based Breast Cancer Classification and Evaluation" project. The code is written in Python v3.11.0, and it is recommended to use Python >=3.10 for compatibility.
  
### Prerequisites  
Before running the code, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

### Project Structure
Make sure the folder Dataset2 is located in the same directory as the notebook project2. The folder structure should look like this:

21IM30005_A2/  
    ├── project2.ipynb  
    ├── Dataset2/  
    │   ├── FNA  
    |       ├── benign
    |           ├── ...
    |       └── malignant
    |           ├── ...
    │   └── test
    |       ├──all_classes
    |           ├── ...
    └── requirements.txt  

### Running the Code
Once you have installed the required libraries and organized your project structure as described above, you can run the code by opening the ```project2.ipynb``` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python IDE of your choice.
